    <div class="text">
      This page contains an overview of the code for this tile puzzle.
      The TilePuzzle applet can be tried <a href="TilePuzzle.html">here</a>.
      Further information about the algorithm and code for solving the puzzle automatically can be viewed <a href="TilePuzzle_solution.html">here</a>.
    </div>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <div class="text">
      <p>
      I began this code because I had several of these puzzles as a child and I was interested in developing an algorithm for solving them automatically. 
      As I developed the display I adapted it to demonstrate the AWT UI because there were few "practical" examples when I was starting with Java.
      The code is commented but this page is intended to give a quick guide to the code and the way in which the classes interact - to find out more, see the code itself.
      </p>
      <p>
      The number of tiles can be customised, and there are three "styles" for the tiles -
      one makes each a Button, another draws each tile using the Graphics functions and the third uses an Image from a file (here it's a photo of plants by the wall of my garage).
      You can also tell the applet to solve the puzzle automatically and adjust the rate at which it does so.
      </p>
      <p>
      The applet display can be considered as having three sections : top, middle and bottom.
      At the top is one of the Controls classes. In the middle is one of the PuzzleDisplay classes.
      At the bottom is the InformationPanel class.
      </p>
      <p>
      From a developer's perspective, there is some separation of form and function.
      The "function" part comes from the Data classes which encapsulate the logical layout of tiles :
      the Display classes represent the "form" part and determine how each tile is presented to the user.
      There are also various controls to "customise" the behaviour of the applet.
      Each set of controls has its own Controls class and communicates with the main class through the Data class.
      Finally, there are Event classes to facilitate the passing of messages between the Display, Data and Control classes and also the main controlling applet class.
      <dl>
        <dt>For example :- </dt><dd>When the OK button in the SpeedControls class is clicked a SpeedOK message is passed, via the AutoData class, to the TilePuzzle class which then makes the adjustment to the speed.</dd>
      </dl>
      In theory, this structure will allow different UI presentations or underlying data structures to be implemented without changing the messaging control.
      </p>

    <h2>General</h2>
    <div class="text">
    <h3><a href="TilePuzzle.java">TilePuzzle</a></h3>
      This is the main applet/application class.
      Its principal roles are to display the UI elements detailed below and to control the underlying Data class.
      As the applet class, it also controls the initialization and running of the applet.
      <p>
      The method which principally defines the behaviour of the class is <span class="emphasis">puzzleChange</span>, from the <span id="class">PuzzleListener</span> interface.
      The <span class="emphasis">SolutionListener</span> interface uses the <span class="emphasis">solutionChanged</span> method to react to the progress of the automated solution.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="text">
      <h3><a href="PuzzlePosition.java">PuzzlePosition</a></h3>
      The puzzle consists of tiles arranged in rows and columns.
      For example, initially tile 1 is at row 1 column 1; tile 2 is at row 1 column 2.
      Each possible position can be represented by the row and column to which it belongs.
      This class encapsulates that row/column pair and adds methods to test positions relative to each other.
    </div>
    <br/>

    <div class="text">
      <h3><a href="Random1.java">Random1</a></h3>
      The <span class="emphasis">shuffle</span> method in <span class="emphasis">PuzzleData</span> needs random numbers from a range of integers.
      Unfortunately, the JVM of some browsers (including Netscape 4 which I was then using) are 1.1 compliant and the Java Random class did not have such a method until 1.2.
      So I made a simple extension of Random and added <span class="emphasis">nextIntFromRange</span>.
    </div>
    <br/>

    <div class="text">
      <h3><a href="InformationPanel.java">InformationPanel</a></h3>
        Shows a read-only text field for the display of informational text.
	When the <span class="emphasis">PuzzleImageDisplay</span> is selected, a thumbnail of the the main image is added to the InformationPanel.
    </div>
    <br/>

    <div class="text">
      <h3><a href="ThumbnailImage.java">ThumbnailImage</a></h3>
        Used in the InformationPanel component to display a small version of the image displayed in the ImagePuzzleDisplay.
    </div>
    <br/>

    <div class="text">
      <h3><a href="RegularControls.java">RegularControls</a></h3>
        Offers buttons to shuffle and automatically solve the puzzle.
	There are also buttons to switch to the customizing controls (ResizeControls, StyleControls and SpeedControls).
    </div>
    <br/>

    <div class="text">
      <h3><a href="ResizeControls.java">ResizeControls</a></h3>
        Offers text fields to specify the number of rows and columns in the puzzle, and buttons to confirm or reject the new dimensions.
    </div>
    <br/>

    <div class="text">
      <h3><a href="StyleControls.java">StyleControls</a></h3>
        Offers radio buttons to choose the type of puzzle display, and buttons to confirm or reject the new style.
    </div>
    <br/>

    <div class="text">
     <h3><a href="SpeedControls.java">SpeedControls</a></h3>
        Offers a drop down list to specify the rate at which the puzzle will be solved automatically, and buttons to confirm or reject the new speed.
    </div>
    <br/>

    <div class="text">
      <h3><a href="FilePreviewer.java">FilePreviewer</a></h3>
        Allows the user to navigate the file system to choose an image file.

    <h2>Displays</h2>
    <div class="text">
      <ul>These classes present the puzzle to the user and identify which tile has been clicked.
      <li>
      PuzzleDisplay is the abstract foundation class.
      </li>
      <li>
      AutoDisplay extends PuzzleDisplay to display tiles when the puzzle is being automatically solved.
      </li>
      <li>
      ButtonPuzzleDisplay and DrawnPuzzleDisplay are descended directly from AutoDisplay.
      </li>
      <li>
      ImagePuzzleDisplay is descended from DrawnPuzzleDisplay.
      </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="text">
      <h3><a href="PuzzleDisplay.java">PuzzleDisplay</a></h3>
      Visually, the puzzle is a set of tiles with each tile having a <span class="variation">background</span>, a <span class="variation">frame</span> and a <span class="variation">value</span>.
      Each of these display elements has an associated colour.
      The default <span class="emphasis">drawTile</span> method displays the background, then the frame and finally the value.
      The tiles also have a defined height and width.
      <p>
      The default <span class="emphasis">drawTileValue</span> method calls different methods depending on the "role" of the tile : each tile is either <span class="variation">Normal</span>, <span class="variation">Blank</span> or <span class="variation">Movable</span>.
      The <span class="variation">Blank</span> tile represents the tile which has been removed to allow the other tiles to be rearranged.
      The <span class="variation">Normal</span> tiles in the puzzle cannot be moved as they are locked in place by other tiles.
      A <span class="variation">Movable</span> tile is one of the tiles adjacent to the blank tile which can be moved (by sliding in the real world).
      </p>
      <p>
      The other major requirement of the puzzle display - the ability to identify when the user wants to move a tile - is supported by <span class="emphasis">requestPuzzleMove</span>, which sends a "Click" message via the underlying Data class.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="text">
      <h3><a href="AutoDisplay.java">AutoDisplay</a></h3>
      Also an abstract class, AutoDisplay extends the basic PuzzleDisplay to add the role of a <span class="variation">Solving</span> tile i.e. the tile which the applet is attempting to move to its final "solved" position.
      As with the other roles the tile can have an associated colour.
      <p>
      The other addition is the makeNormal flag which is used during the automated solution.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="text">
      <h3><a href="PuzzleButtonDisplay.java">PuzzleButtonDisplay</a></h3>
      PuzzleButtonDisplay extends AutoDisplay and uses the Container behaviour of a Panel to implement the puzzle as a set of Button components.
      This simplifies the display requirements by relying on the GridLayout to place the tiles in a regular design.
      A click on a tile is now a click on a button, so the actionListener for the buttons is diverted to <span class="emphasis">actionPerformed</span> in this class for handling.
      The only significant problem is converting the source component to a tile position : this is handled with <span class="emphasis">findButtonIndex</span> and <span class="emphasis">getPositionForOrdinal</span>
      <p>
      Because this is a concrete, not an abstract class, the abstract methods must be overridden : <span class="emphasis">drawBlankTile</span>, <span class="emphasis">drawSolvingTile</span>, <span class="emphasis">drawMovableTile</span>, <span class="emphasis">drawNormalTile</span>, <span class="emphasis">drawTileBackground</span> and <span class="emphasis">drawTileFrame</span> must be defined for a button.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="text">
      <h3><a href="PuzzleDrawnDisplay.java">PuzzleDrawnDisplay</a></h3>
      PuzzleDrawnDisplay extends AutoDisplay and uses the Canvas behaviour of a Panel to implement the puzzle by drawing each tile with the Graphics methods.
      During the initialisation, the size of the tiles is calculated and stored.
      The dimensions are then used by the Graphics routines in the overridden methods without recalculation.
      A click on a tile is now a click on the canvas, so <span class="emphasis">DrawnAdapter</span> is used to trap mouse clicks and convert the coordinates to a tile position.
      <p>
      Because this is a concrete, not an abstract class, the abstract methods must be overridden : <span class="emphasis">drawBlankTile</span>, <span class="emphasis">drawSolvingTile</span>, <span class="emphasis">drawMovableTile</span>, <span class="emphasis">drawNormalTile</span>, <span class="emphasis">drawTileBackground</span> and <span class="emphasis">drawTileFrame</span> must be defined for a button.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="text">
      <h3><a href="PuzzleImageDisplay.java">PuzzleImageDisplay</a></h3>
      PuzzleImageDisplay extends PuzzleDrawnDisplay and adds an ImageObserver interface to implement the puzzle using an image.
      It overrides <span class="emphasis">drawTileValue</span> to draw each tile as a portion of the image.
      The <span class="emphasis">buildPuzzleFromData</span> method scales the image to  fit the display dimensions and uses those values to calculate the tile size.
    </div>

    <hr>

    <h2>Data</h2>
    <div class="text">
      These classes support the logical representation of the puzzle.
      PuzzleData is the foundation class for representing the the logical layout of the tiles in the puzzle.
      AutoData extends PuzzleData for when the puzzle may be automatically solved.
    </div>
    <br/>

    <div class="text">
      <h3><a href="PuzzleData.java">PuzzleData</a></h3>
      Logically, the puzzle is a rectangular matrix of tiles, one of which is <span class="variation">blank</span>.
      The only tiles in the puzzle which can be <span class="variation">move</span>d are those directly above and below the blank and those directly to the left and right of the blank.
      <p>
      Each tile in the puzzle has a <span class="variation">value</span> (represented as an ordinal) and a <span class="variation">position</span> (represented as a <a href="PuzzlePosition.java">PuzzlePosition</a>).
      For example, in a solved puzzle with 4 rows and 4 columns, the tile with value 7 will be at row 2 column 4 :
      when the puzzle is scrambled, the same tile could be in any position.
      Therefore, this class must keep track of the positions and values of the tiles, and provides the following information
      <ul>
        <li>the value of tile for a given tile position</li>
        <li>the current tile position for a given tile value</li>
        <li>the (target) tile position for a given tile value when the puzzle is solved</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
      The only tiles in the puzzle which can be <span class="variation">move</span>d are those directly above and below the blank and those directly to the left and right of the blank.
      The class has methods to return a list of all movable tiles and also to indicate whether a given tile is movable.
      The moveTile method will "move" a tile, which is actually swapping the positions of the movable tile and the blank tile.
      To assist in handling movable tiles, the <span class="emphasis">getPositionToRight</span>, <span class="emphasis">getPositionToLeft</span>, <span class="emphasis">getPositionAbove</span> and <span class="emphasis">getPositionBelow</span> methods return those relative tile positions for a given tile.
      Of course, if the blank tile is (say) in the leftmost column, there is no valid movable tile to the left.
      To cater for this, there are methods to predefine <span class="variation">invalid</span> tile positions and values and to check for them.
      </p>
      <p>
      The other major function of the PuzzleData class is to be a central exchange for <span class="variation">puzzle events</span> and to notify the puzzle listeners when events occur.
      This is reasonable because, in general, puzzle events reflect changes in the data class.
      It would add complexity to create a special messaging center just to cater for a few exceptional events.
      But there is a <span class="emphasis">sendmessage</span> method to cater for message events and that uses the puzzle listeners too.
      </p>
      <p>
      The other methods of note are <span class="emphasis">shuffle</span> and <span class="emphasis">shufflePuzzle</span>, which "shuffle" the puzzle by moving the tiles at random.
      <p>
    </div>

    <div class="text">
      <h3><a href="AutoData.java">AutoData</a></h3>
      AutoData extends PuzzleData to support automated puzzle solutions.
      At any time, the puzzle may have an associated <a href="PuzzleSolution.java">PuzzleSolution</a>.
      A PuzzleSolution can generate <a href="SolutionEvent.java">SolutionEvent</a>s and Autodata has methods for managing <a href="SolutionListener.java">SolutionListener</a>s to respond to those events.
      <p>
      The class also stores the tile value of the <span class="variation">Solving</span> tile i.e. the tile which the <span class="emphasis">PuzzleSolution</span> is attempting to move to its final "solved" position.
      When choosing which should be the solving tile, the usual choice is the "lowest" unsolved tile as returned by <span class="emphasis">getLowestUnsolvedValue</span>.
      </p>
    </div>

      <hr/>

      <h2>Events and Listeners</h2>
    <div class="text">
      These are extensions of the standard ActionEvent and EventListener classes.
    </div>
    <br/>

    <div class="text">
      <h3><a href="PuzzleEvent.java">PuzzleEvent</a>, <a href="PuzzleListener.java">PuzzleListener</a></h3>
      These classes work in tandem to keep the components of the applet in sync.
      The events are usually propagated through the AutoData class.
    </div>
    <br/>


    <div class="text">
      <h3><a href="SolutionEvent.java">SolutionEvent</a>, <a href="SolutionListener.java">SolutionListener</a></h3>
