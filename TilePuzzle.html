	This applet simulates a sliding tile puzzle you may recall from childhood :
one tile has been removed to allow the others to be rearranged.
	<br/>
The code can also be run as an application.
	</div>
    <br/>

	<div class="text">
There is general information about the code design <a href="TilePuzzle_code.html">here</a>.
	<br/>
More information about the "solving" algorithm and its related code is <a href="TilePuzzle_solution.html">here</a>.
	</div>
	<br/>
	<div class="text">
      You can change the number of rows and columns in the puzzle by clicking on the "Resize" button and entering the new values. 
	<ul>You can also choose the method used to show the tiles of the puzzle by clicking on the "Style" button 
	<li>"Button" - makes each tile a Button
	</li>
	<li>"Drawn" - draws each tile using the Graphics functions
	</li>
	<li>"Image" - uses an Image from a file (by default, the file is puzzle.jpg and shows plants by my garage wall).
      Note that choosing the Image style will cause the the image to be loaded, which could take a while.
	</li>
	</ul>
	</div>
	<br/>

	<div class="text">
      To try the puzzle, just click on any of the rectangular divisions or "tiles" within it. That tile will move to the position occupied by the blank tile. 
      Rather than jumbling the puzzle manually you can choose to click on "Shuffle" which will rapidly move tiles at random and then display the resulting layout. 
      Pressing "Shuffle" again will repeat the process.
	<br/>
	<ul> When the puzzle is not in its initial or "solved" state, you have the option to have the computer solve the puzzle for you.
	<li>
      Pressing "Reset" will immediately return the puzzle to its solved state without showing any intermediate moves. 
	</li>
	<li>
      Pressing "Move" will cause a single tile to be moved each time it is pressed until the puzzle is completely solved. 
	</li>
	<li>
      Pressing "Solve it" will move tiles using a timer until the puzzle is solved or the user clicks "Stop Solving" or "Reset". 
      The rate at which tiles are moved can be varied by clicking on the "Speed" button and selecting the desired rate.
	</li>
	</ul>
      One point worth making is that the automatic solution is not simply a reversal of the "Shuffle" process. 
      To see this you can shuffle the puzzle manually and then use "Move" or "Solve it" to see just how effortlessly the <a href="TilePuzzle_solution.html">algorithm</a> copes. 
      Sadly, you may as easily see just how stupid it can be too.

      If you want to download all the source in one go, <a href="puzzle.zip">this</a> is a zipped set of the files. 
      If you just want to use the applet in your own stuff but don't need to compile it yourself, <a href="puzzle.jar">this</a> is the compiled archive(jar) : to use your own image change the "img" parameter to refer to it (or rename your image to <code>puzzle.jpg</code>).
