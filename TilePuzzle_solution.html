Overview
</h2>
    <div class="text">
    <p>
This page contains information about the algorithm and code for solving the tile puzzle automatically.
The TilePuzzle applet can be tried <a href="TilePuzzle.html">here</a>.
An overview of the code can be viewed <a href="TilePuzzle_code.html">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
One significant "improvement" over the simple plastic puzzles is that this applet can solve itself automatically. 
The <span class="emphasis">run</span> method in the applet class periodically calls <span class="emphasis">nextAutoMove</span>. 
If automatic solving is operating, the automated solution class builds and sends a request to move the next tile.
The request is handled in the <span class="emphasis">puzzleChange</span> method which calls <span class="emphasis">moveTile</span> to take care of the move.
    </p>
    <p>
The tricky stuff is in deciding which tile to move : this is the job
of the <a href="PuzzleSolution.java">PuzzleSolution</a> class and its offspring.
Generally, once a tile is in its final position it is not moved again. 
The overall strategy in line with this is to start at the top left and move right along each row, then down to the next row and repeat. 
The last two rows are treated differently : they are solved a column at a time, upper tile first and then normally calling <span class="emphasis">SolveLastRow</span> for the lower tile. 
This solving order is mirrored in the <span class="emphasis">getLowestUnsolvedValue</span> method in AutoData. 
In practice, it is that method which is used to determine the next tile to solve.
    </p>
    <p>
A special case is when the puzzle has only two columns.
In that circumstance, a similar technique to the last two rows is applied (<span class="emphasis">SolveLastRow</span> and <span class="emphasis">SolveRightColumn</span> are essentially the same algorithm rotated through ninety degrees).
    </p>
    <p>
Above the last two rows, the general case is to move the "solving" tile towards its target position by alternately moving it up and either left or right towards its target position.
When a tile is to the left of its target position we must be careful not to move it up into the target row because that would disturb the already solved tiles. 
Moving a tile left or right when it is immediately below solved tiles can be seen as moving the blank under the "solving" tile. 
Likewise, moving a tile up can be seen as moving the blank around the side (normally right) of the solving tile.
    </p>
    <p>
Solving the tile in the rightmost column (<span class="emphasis">SolveLastColumn</span>) requires additional considerations. 
Firstly, moving a tile up when it is the rightmost column requires that the blank must move around the left side of the tile (because there is no column to the right for it to move into). 
Secondly, except for the trivial case where the target position is blank immediately above the "solving" tile, it is not possible to move the last tile in without disturbing the already solved tiles.
If <span class="emphasis">getLowestUnsolvedValue</span> was evaluated after each tile move, every time we disturbed one of the solved tiles it would flag it as unsolved and move it back. 
Therefore we need to delay evaluation until after a sequence of individual tile moves needed to position the rightmost tile. 
This requirement demands the support for complex sequences of moves which execute to completion before checking for the next tile to be solved. 
That same facility (complex moves) is used for the two-column puzzles and for the last two rows of other puzzles.

Solution hierarchy</h2>
    <div class="text">
    <p>
Solving the puzzle consists of many tile moves - too many for me to grasp in its entirety. 
Even moving a single tile into position can take many steps, many of which comprise repeated sequences.
So there are classes which support multiple tile moves to perform some of those repeated sequences. 
This permits building a solution at a higher level of abstraction than individual tile moves. 
The base class for these complex sequences is <span class="emphasis">PuzzleMove</span>. 
This supports a sequence of moves to a target position around a reference position. 
The reference position is calculated implicitly when the class is initialised, but some situations
require that it is set explicitily to modify the behaviour of the class.
</p>
<p>When building the solution, I found it easier to imagine "moving" the
blank rather than moving the tiles. Hence, there are several classes which
clearly move the blank regardless of the tiles being moved - <span class="emphasis">MoveBlankTo</span>,
<span class="emphasis">MoveBlankRightTo</span>,
<span class="emphasis">MoveBlankLeftTo</span>,
<span class="emphasis">MoveBlankUpTo</span>,
<span class="emphasis">MoveBlankDownTo</span>, <span class="emphasis">RotateBlankTo</span> and
<span class="emphasis">AntiRotateBlankTo</span>. Along with the basic <span class="emphasis">MoveTile</span>, these classes
form the building blocks for moving a tile to its target (solved) position.
</p>
<p>The next step is building classes to deal with various situations. 
<ul>
The major situations I recognised (and classes to deal with them) are
<li>
last row (<span class="emphasis">SolveLastRow</span>)- to "solve" the tile in the bottom row we
generally need to disturb the solved tile above it;
</li>
<li>
last column (<span class="emphasis">SolveLastColumn</span>) - to "solve" the tile in the rightmost
column we generally need to disturb the two solved tiles to the left of
its target position;
</li>
<li>
right column of two (<span class="emphasis">SolveRightColumn</span>) - to "solve" the tile in the rightmost
column we disturb the solved tiles to the left of its target position;
</li>
<li>
tile to the left of its target position (<span class="emphasis">SolveFromLeft</span>) - must move
tile to the right without disturbing the solved tiles to the left of its
target position;
</li>
<li>
normal situation (<span class="emphasis">SolveNormal</span>) - none of the above ( target position
to the left or above or both ).
</li>
</ul>
Of course, within each situation there are smaller complications. Usually,
these involve initially positioning the blank next to the solving tile.
</p>
<p>To complete the solution, there are the <span class="emphasis">SolveTileValue</span> and <span class="emphasis">SolveTilePuzzle</span>
classes. The <span class="emphasis">SolveTileValue</span> class puts the previous classes together
to move an individual tile to its target position. The <span class="emphasis">SolveTilePuzzle</span>
class creates <span class="emphasis">SolveTileValue</span> classes for each tile until all the
entire puzzle has been solved.
</p>

<h2 align="center">
Class methods for solution</h2>
    <div class="text">
One of the key features of the solution/move classes is the ability to
be driven from a timer, which requires persistence of information.
<ul>
<li>
So, the position of all tiles in the puzzle must be available to the solution(<span class="emphasis">setData</span>
and <span class="emphasis">getData</span>).</li>

<li>
The tiles to be moved for the solution must be obtained one at a time (<span class="emphasis">getTileToMove</span>).
</li>

<li>
It must be possible to identify when all of the tiles have been obtained(<span class="emphasis">isComplete</span>).
</li>

<li>
Clearly, it must also be possible to specify the objective of the move(<span class="emphasis">setTargetPosition</span>
and <span class="emphasis">setTargetValue</span>).
</li>

<li>
In more complex classes, there are methods to move to the next stage in
the solution (<span class="emphasis">nextStage</span>) and to specify a reference position which will modify the
"route" of the solution(<span class="emphasis">setReferencePosition</span>).
</li>

<li>
Last, we need a method to figure out the next step in the move(<span class="emphasis">calculateNextMove</span>).
</li>
</ul>
