          TilePuzzle
          ----------
Simulates a sliding tile puzzle. These were a common and cheap plastic toy in my childhood. I enjoyed solving them and when, much later, I was looking for a fun project to get to grips with Borland's Delphi it seemed a good candidate.

About ten years later I was in a similar situation with learning Java and this code was the result. There is documentation in the form of two html pages.

These days it's showing its age. In particular it uses AWT graphics because browser support for anything else was uncertain when I wrote it. Nonetheless, IMHO the solving algorithm is quite interesting and provides example code for several useful techniques e.g. extending the base Move object to cope with complex sequences and using custom Listeners and events.

This repository contains source code and a jar archive as well as build scripts I used on my Slackware box. It's all licensed under the GPL v2.
